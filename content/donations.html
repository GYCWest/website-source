	<h1>An Explanation</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17.</p>
	<p>All of us in the GYC West team are volunteers.  Yet any such venture has costs - both for the event and ongoing. The past few years have been very hard times, and we were very close to closing our doors. Yet by God's grace we were able to continue without interruption. One result of that struggle is that we realized, with God's help and much prayer, that we needed to open the doors and put out a place to receive donations - much like Jehoiada the priest under king Jehoash in 2 Kings 12:9. This page is that place.</p>

	<h1>Inspiration Box</h1>
	<p>[T]hose who have the ability and means might do a great deal in stirring up the people of God, and if they would venture out and risk something in the result and success of this message, it would inspire faith in the hearts of the remnant and there would be activity and zeal in pushing forward this great work.</p>
