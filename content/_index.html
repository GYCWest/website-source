		</div>
		<details>
			<p>Paul Coneff, Marriage and Family Therapist, focuses on applying Jesus' mission statement to 'heal broken hearts and set the captives free.' He is also the author of “The Hidden Half of the Gospel: How His Suffering Can Heal Yours,” and “Brutally Honest: Discovering A God You Can Trust With Your Deepest Wounds and Darkest Desires” (www.hiddenhalf.org), and president of Straight 2 the Heart's non-profit discipleship ministry - shares how Jesus' story of suffering betrayal, abuse, rejection, abandonment, temptation to numb His pain etc. allows Him to identify with us in our story, heal us and set us free.</p>
			<p>His passion is to multiply “Great Commission” disciples who are receiving Jesus' healing and freedom so they can move into ministry with a testimony in their community so that “every true disciple is born into the kingdom of God a missionary,” (DA 195).</p>
			<p>Paul loves seeing the local church developing discipleship teams who are impacting their community for Christ, with the whole gospel, for the whole person, going to the whole world. (Matt. 28:18-20; Rev. 14:6), for the whole person, going to the whole world.</p>
