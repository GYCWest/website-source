			<h1>Hannah &amp; Jerry Rasmussen</h1>
			<!-- <p>Topic here</p> -->
		</div>
		<details>
			<p>Hannah grew up in the beautiful mountains of British Columbia and was blessed to be raised by SDA parents who value nature as an expression of the Creator's love. She currently lives in Washington State where she works with a midwifery practice and birth center that provides pregnancy, birth, and mother-and-baby care for low-risk women. She still enjoys the simple beauties of nature as a revaluation of the Creator, Who uses every possible means to bless and draw His children to Him. Her favorite Bible verse is Hebrews 10:23, “Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;).”</p>
			<p>Jerry Rasmussen, Hannah's father, was raised in a pastor's home in northern California surrounded by the beauty and awesome grandeur of the Sierra-Nevada Mountains. At the early age of five he felt drawn to work for the Lord Jesus Christ. As a teenager, he realized that God has no grandchildren and he chose to recommit to Jesus and make this relationship his own. His love of the ocean and tide pooling was cultivated while living near Trinidad (California Coast). He feels blessed when he finds himself in a white water raft or canoe, on a mountain top, or at a tide pool. In 1986, after receiving his teaching certificate from Pacific Union College, he taught science, Bible, and math at a variety of Academies in California, Montana, and is currently teaching in British Columbia, Canada. His primary focus has been to inspire young people with the joy of discovery and realizing their uniquely personal potential as missionaries for the Master. He enjoys helping others learn about God's love, power, and trustworthiness through His Word and created works.</p>

		<address>34000 Albion St, Albion, CA 95410</address>
		<p>A note about GPS: Google Maps has been proven accurate, however the last bit where you drive off of Highway 1 onto Albion Ridge Rd then onto Albion St can be a little difficult to see - it caught many of us the first time! When you turn off of Highway 1, pull into the parking lot you see in front of some small storefronts. Off the north-east end of the lot are two rough roads, the right fork is the one you are looking for - you'll see a little blue-on-white sign for the Albion Field Station. We'll have GYC West signage out where possible.</p>
		<p>Expect temperatures in the 50° to 70° range, with refreshingly moist ocean winds and lots of sun.</p>
