	<p>Each year GYC West hosts a young adult retreat to gain strength in the faith, network safely with like-minded believers, and seek a closer communion with our Father.
		For 2021 the theme is "No Limit… to what God can do."
		During this past year many people have found themselves confronted with questions and concerns regarding God and His power. Has COVID limited God's ability to work in our lives? Does the division and fear in our country and the world limit God's ability to work through us?
		We believe nothing can limit our Lord's work when we follow His Word and we want to encourage you to trust Him alone.</p>
	<p>Join us in 2021 to come away from your work and routines and seek revival together.</p>

		<address>7169 Sierra Pines Rd, Twin Bridges, CA 95721</address>
		<p>Be sure to bring an active mind, your Bible, and notepaper as this year's content is designed to bring you not only closer to our Savior, but also to give you the tools you need to become a strong worker for Him at your home and at your church.</p>
		<p>Please be aware that we will be recording and live streaming our events, so please dress modestly.</p>
		<p>A note about GPS: Google Maps has been proven to be accurate, however it tries to direct you off of Sierra Pines Road too early and onto a blocked road. Follow the road further down. We will have GWC West signs up to help guide you.</p>

		<p>This <script type="text/javascript">if ((new Date()).getFullYear() < 2020) document.write("next ");</script>year's GYC West is being held at Barlow Group Camp, just south of Ruth Lake in Trinity County California.</p>
		<address>Barlow Group Camp, just off of Lower Mad River Rd at Barlow Camp Rd</address>
		-->
		<!--
		<p>A note about GPS: Google Maps has been proven to be accurate, however the last bit where you drive off of Highway 1 onto Albion Ridge Rd then onto Albion St can be a little difficult to see - it caught many of us the first time! When you turn off of Highway 1, pull into the parking lot you see in front of some small storefronts. Off the North-East end of the lot are two rough roads, the right fork is the one you are looking for - you'll see a little blue-on-white sign for the Albion Field Station.</p>
		<p>Expect temperatures in the 50° to 70° range, with refreshingly moist ocean winds and lots of sun.</p>
		-->
		<!-- <p>Tent camping is recommended and RVs are welcome - there are no on-site cabins or other lodgings. Each campsite is limited to a maximum of 8 people and up to 2 vehicles.</p> -->
		<!-- <p>Please review the <a href="https://www.ruthlakecsd.org/sidebar/map-of-ruth-lake/campground-rules/">campground rules</a> for detailed site rules.</p> -->
		
		<h1>History Note</h1>
		<p>This site once belonged to the Adventist church - before Leoni Meadows was purchased. The main building, currently known as Judson Lodge, was built in the 1940s and Seventh-Day Adventist missionaries from around the world sent rocks and shells from their various missions that were all incorporated into the fireplace at the ends of the building.</p>
		<p>Come and visit this historic location! One of our many goals for this event is to do what we can to improve the site to those around us, so come with a heart and mind willing to work for the Lord.</p>
