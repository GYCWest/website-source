	<p>GYC West 2018 is in the works. Based on asking you about how you would like to see GYC West move forward along with a lot of prayer and inspiration from God, we are reworking how the yearly session is being held: we plan to create a much more social, team environment with a lot less lecture and a lot more doing. Needless to say, we are very excited about what's coming up - so stay tuned!</p>
