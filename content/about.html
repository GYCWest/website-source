	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	<p>GYC West is an organization of Seventh-day Adventist youth and young adults in the western United States. We believe that the Lord is forming His army of workers in these last days and our prayer is that GYC West would be a vessel through which Jesus Christ can reveal His will.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. If you are planning on being in the area, we invite you to come. We also invite you to use this conference as a means of personal evangelism for friends of yours that may be struggling in their faith. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17. We hope to see you there!</p>

		<h1>Jeaneva Jackson, VP of Communications</h1>
		<img src="/img/staff/2018/2018Jeaneva.jpg"/>
		<p>I was born and raised in Sacramento, CA. I currently work at Diagnsotic Pathology Medical Group, where I work as a medical biller, for state/county, prisons and contract billing.</p>
		<p>I first started going to a Seventh Day Adventist church in 2006 when my mom was baptized at Sacramento Central SDA church, even though I was going I didn't feel any conviction to change my life. It wasn't until 2010, I was 21 and my parents were downstairs watching Doug Batchelor on TV, my dad likes the TV loud so I was hearing the sermon he was preaching and I don't remember the topic but I remember feeling a conviction that I wanted to hear more so I stopped what I was doing and started listening to the sermon. I remember feeling so convicted that I started to watch more of his sermons and attend church regularly with my mom. I decided to throw away all the things in my life that kept me from Christ and started studying with Central's bible worker Jennifer. After studying I was ready to be baptized and in 2010 Pastor Doug baptized me at Sac Central and it has been my home church for the past 8 years.</p>
		<p>Over time I have fallen in love with everything outdoors especially hiking. I love to read my bible and SOP whenever I can and I love studying prophecy and learning about the sanctuary.</p>
