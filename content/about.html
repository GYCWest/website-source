	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	<p>GYC West is an organization of Seventh-day Adventist youth and young adults in the western United States. We believe that the Lord is forming His army of workers in these last days and our prayer is that GYC West would be a vessel through which Jesus Christ can reveal His will.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. If you are planning on being in the area, we invite you to come. We also invite you to use this conference as a means of personal evangelism for friends of yours that may be struggling in their faith. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17. We hope to see you there!</p>
