	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	<p>GYC West exists to motivate and empower Seventh-day Adventist youth and young adults to fulfill their role in Godâ€™s plan for these last days. Through training in evangelism, leadership, and discipleship, we provide tools for a life of impactful service. Our retreats rejuvenate mind, body, and spirit, encouraging deeper connections with God and His creation.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. If you are planning on being in the area, we invite you to come. We also invite you to use this conference as a means of personal evangelism for friends of yours that may be struggling in their faith. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17. We hope to see you there!</p>

		<p>Growing up in Humboldt County, California, I have always had an appreciation for nature. I enjoy hiking and traveling, looking for interesting plants, landscapes, and other quirks wherever I go.
			I have a passion for AV. I enjoy helping out and learning new techniques to make high quality live presentations and recordings.
