	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	<p>GYC West is an organization of Seventh-day Adventist youth and young adults in the western United States. We believe that the Lord is forming His army of workers in these last days and our prayer is that GYC West would be a vessel through which Jesus Christ can reveal His will.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. If you are planning on being in the area, we invite you to come. We also invite you to use this conference as a means of personal evangelism for friends of yours that may be struggling in their faith. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17. We hope to see you there!</p>

		<h1>Karl Rosaasen, VP of Evangelism</h1>
		<img src="/img/staff/2022/2022karlrosaasen.jpg"/>
		<p>I grew up in mountains of Northern California. I was home-schooled through high school and really enjoyed attending my home church in Brownsville, CA. I went canvassing one summer distributing biblical literature and books and decided to go to an evangelism school called SOULS Northwest in Washington state. For quite a few summers after that I continued to canvas and decided to go to college at Weimar college and took nursing there. While at Weimar, I enjoyed the community outreach we did each Wednesday called TCI (total community involvement) where we got to help people rake leaves, give Bible studies, or just go caroling and pass out cookies. I currently live in a town near Brownsville, work at the emergency room at a hospital in Marysville, and I'm volunteering at our local fire department. I love playing cello, hiking, traveling, and learning Spanish.</p>
